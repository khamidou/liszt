This is liszt, a command line interface to the todoliszt.com api.

liszt supports (at the moment) four modes of operation : showing, creating, removing a list or
updating an element of a list.

Requirements
============

python-dateutil, simplejson (usually included on all the recent python installations).

Basic Usage
===========

* Creating a list

  liszt create "my list"
  Shortcuts : instead of "create", "c"
  	      if the name of the list is a single word, you can get rid of the quotation marks.

* Creating a entry in an already existing list
  
  liszt create "my list" "my entry"
  Shortcuts : you can ommit the quotation marks altogether. Liszt will assume that the name of the list is a 
  	      single word and add the rest of the words to the contents of the entry.

* Getting the contents of a list

  liszt show "my list" gets the contents of the list "my list".
  Shortcuts : the name of the list is globbable (liszt show "my *" will print the same results) - if there are multiple matches, 
  	      liszt will ask you a globbing sub-pattern to narrow down the search.
  
* Getting the contents of an entry

  liszt show "my list" entry_index displays the contents of the entry #entry_index.
  
  The format of output of an entry is first the index of the entry in the list, then its description, its creation date and finally if it's done.
  The fields are separated by tabs.

* Removing a list

  liszt remove "my list"
  liszt remove "my list" entry_index

* Adding entries in batch mode

  liszt add "my list"
  
  This will fire-up the text editor defined in the EDITOR environment variable. The file format is a bit peculiar : each entry is separated by a '+'
  symbol. After adding the entries, save and quit. Liszt will automatically add the entries to your todoliszt.com list.

* Updating the entries of a list

  liszt update "my list"

  Similarly to the 'add' option, update will open up a text editor with the content of the list "my list". The file format is similar to the one used with
  the 'add' option : each entry begins with a + symbol. The contents of an entry are (in this order) : the text of an entry, a boolean indicating if it's
  been done or not and a timestamp.
  After saving and quitting, the list is automatically updated.
