This is liszt, a command line interface to the todoliszt.com api.

liszt supports (at the moment) three modes of operation : showing, creating, removing a list or
an element of a list.

Basic Usage
===========

* Creating a list

  liszt create "my list"
  Shortcuts : instead of "create", "c"
  	      if the name of the list is a single word, you can get rid of the quotation marks.

* Creating a entry in an already existing list
  
  liszt create "my list" "my entry"
  Shortcuts : you can ommit the quotation marks altogether. Liszt will assume that the name of the list is a 
  	      single word and add the rest of the words to the contents of the entry.

* Getting the contents of a list

  liszt show "my list" gets the contents of the list "my list".
  Shortcuts : the name of the list is globbable (liszt show "my *" will print the same results) - if there are multiple matches, 
  	      liszt will ask you a globbing sub-pattern to narrow down the search.
  
* Getting the contents of an entry

  liszt show "my list" entry_index displays the contents of the entry #entry_index.
  
  The format of output of an entry is first the index of the entry in the list, then its description, its creation date and finally if it's done.
  The fields are separated by tabs.

* Removing a list

  list remove "my list"
  list remove "my list" entry_index
